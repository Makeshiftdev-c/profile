Jokes, aside- one of my best thus far, if I may say so myself :)- I am a dark mode visionary, whose love of coffee comes second only to coding (more aptly, coffee is the Lorem to my coding’s Ipsum). I have been programming, in my spare time, for a few years; mainly solving trivial coding challenges and experimenting with different languages and libraries. My accrued experiences and a touch of inspiration led me down the path of learning about web-development, and I can gladly say I have never looked back.
  
Since then, my efforts have been focused on gaining as much exposure to the different technologies, areas, and general ecosystem that surround the field and its sub-fields. Though, admittedly inexperienced, I am eager to learn, apply, and expand on my current skillset, passionate about development, and hopeful for an opportunity to grow with a business.
